## Project Description
### Purpose
I needed to:
1. Create customer segmentation based on RFM scores and present findings using a dashboard. 
2. Calculate current and predict future CLV using 12 weeks cohort analysis.
## Key Findings 
### RFM
The marketing team should focus first on:
1. At Risk. Customers who spent a high amount of money and bought frequently, but not that recently. They are not at the risk stage yet but are getting there. There are almost 200 client's who are 4th largest revenue generators, so would need to make sure to not lose them. The marketing team would need to try to reconnect with them, through personalized emails, offering renewals, etc. 
2. Need attention. They are above-average spenders with a couple of purchases. However, they also did not make any recent purchases for a while. Even though they do not make the biggest purchases, the business has around 500 clients there who are 3rd largest revenue generators. Thus, worth looking into. Recommendations on past purchases, limited-time offers, etc. may help to reactivate them.
3. Can't lose them. They are top spenders who purchased often. However, they did not make recent purchases for a long time. Even though they seem like the most important ones, due to the low amount of them (28), they do not generate a lot of revenue right now compared to other segments. However, due to being big spenders have potential. Marketing should try to win them back by trying to connect and offer specialized offers, newer products, asking for feedback to understand their needs better. 
### CLV
- Most customers who registered after 2020-12-20 spent almost 3 times less on average.
- Business needs to review the user acquisition strategy changes which happened during and after that time period, to understand what could have caused this. It could be just regular seasonal behavior, but from limited current data, it is not clear.
- For future analysis, it would be good to compare the LTV of profit to the CAC ratio. It would help to understand how much the LTV to CAC ratio fluctuated.
